# Space-Invaders
Space Invaders in Java Swing

This is a reconstruction of the original game with little revisitations. 
The code is written using the Object Oriented Java and Java Swing. The code is totally commented in English in the best way possible I was able to achieve. 
I Recommend NetBeans 11.1, which I used during the development. 

Enjoy! I hope you'll find the code well-written and the program interesting! 

You can also find a report on the program (in Italian) and all its design phase.
This is my first try with GithHub, so I'm sorry for any eventual mistake. 
If you need help or you only want to know something more about me or the code, contact me!

Credits to Riccardo Pacini, my friend and school mate, to have collaborated with me in this project.
